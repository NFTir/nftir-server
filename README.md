## Overview

NFTir is a comprised of two projects which are [NFTir/agent](https://github.com/logann131/NFTir/tree/master/agent) and [NFTir/server](https://github.com/logann131/NFTir/tree/master/server). NFTir utilizes [AWS services](https://aws.amazon.com/) and the [gin-gonic](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) framework to create a web service that polls the [NFTGo server](https://nftgo.io/) and hosts multiple RESTful endpoints that help processing metadata and information of specific NFTs.
